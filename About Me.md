# About Me

My name is Calvin Nanneman. I am a freshman at the University of Missouri. I am pursuing a BS in Information Technology.

#### Military Service
From 2017- 2020 I served in the Army as a Satellite Communications Equipment Operator. This exposed me to many facets of telecommunications and information technology. The experiences I had while serving helped shape my desire to continue education in information technology.

#### Hobbies
I love to hunt and fish. It is something that has been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. 

I played lacrosse in high school, it is my favorite sport to play. I enjoy watching the NCAA games every spring.

I often enjoy casual gaming, everything from Nintendo to PC.
