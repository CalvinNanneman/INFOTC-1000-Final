# Favorite Video Games

In the past I have enjoyed a myriad of games, from first person shooters like ***Halo*** and ***Call of Duty*** to party games like ***Mario Kart*** and ***Smash Bros***. Lately I have been mostly playing two titles, ***Minecraft*** and ***League of Legends***. These two games are diametrically opposed. ***Minecraft*** is very relaxing and a good way to express creativity by building things. ***League of Legends*** on the other hand is ultra competitive and intense.
